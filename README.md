# HackerEarth-DeepLearning-Challenge-2-TDDNet-Implementation
Thoracic Disease Detection Network inspired by the ChextNet architecture [ Stanford ML group ]


### Q1. A Brief on the approach used to solve the Data Problem ?
My submission to the challenge is inspired by the ChexNet model employed for the similar task on NIH Lung Disease Classificaton. 

### Q2. What data-preprocessing / feature engineering ideas really worked? How did you discover them?
Data Augmentation by flipping the image along y-axis. 

### Q3. What does your final model look like? How did you reach it?
The final model was a Densenet-169 with repeating dense blocks comprising of 

### Q4. What are your takeaways from the challenge, if any?


### Q5. According to you, what are the 5 things a participant must focus on while solving such problems?
1. Look for similar problem statements and what standard procedures have been implemented to solve them.
2. How can yyou arrange for cloud cresits like AWS and GCP for training your models and setting up right environment with all the dependencies.
3. Work on a sample of the whole dataset to check if your modelis behaving predictably.
